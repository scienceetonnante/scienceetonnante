## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David Louapre, creator of the Youtube channel "Science Ã©tonnante" http://youtube.com/scienceetonnante, a popular science channel (in French) with more than 1.4 million subscribers.

On this page, you will be able to find code that I used to create simulations for my videos, for instance in the field of physics, computer science, artificial intelligence or applied mathematics.

On top of my Youtube channel, you can find some of my science outreach work here :

(In real life, I'm also working as Scientific director at Ubisoft, the video games company, but for obvious reasons most of that work is proprietary and hence not shared here.)
