## Hi there 👋

I'm David Louapre, creator of the Youtube channel "Science étonnante" http://youtube.com/scienceetonnante, a popular science channel (in French) with more than 1.4 million subscribers. 

I'm also AI Scientist at 🤗Hugging Face, mostly working on **mechanistic interpretability** and **robotics**. 

On this page, you will be able to find code that I used to create **simulations for my videos**, for instance in the field of physics, computer science, artificial intelligence or applied mathematics.

You can also find some of my work in mechanistic interpretability of AI models.

On top of my Youtube channel, you can find some of my science outreach work on my blog http://scienceetonnante.com or Substack https://scienceetonnante.substack.com

(In real life, I'm also working as Scientific director at Ubisoft, the video games company, but for obvious reasons most of that work is proprietary and hence not shared here.)
